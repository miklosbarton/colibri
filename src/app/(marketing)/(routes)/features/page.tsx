                        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 max-w-xl leading-relaxed">At its core is our Cultural Health Index (CHI®), a “cultural thermometer” that measures trust, teamwork, and resilience across your teams. With dashboards for organisations, teams, and individuals, the Platform maps your cultural DNA and shows where attention is needed most.</p>
                        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 max-w-xl leading-relaxed">But it doesn’t stop at measurement. The Platform delivers actionable insights and personalised nudges, helping leaders and employees take the right steps at the right time. It transforms culture from something intangible into something visible, measurable, and manageable.</p>
